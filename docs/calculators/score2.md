**What it gives.** The 10-year risk, in %, of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease. SCORE2
covers ages 40 to 69. SCORE2-OP covers age 70 and over (we take it to 89, the oldest age of its
charts). A profile gets one of the two, never both.

**Formulas.** Total and HDL cholesterol in mmol/L, systolic pressure in mmHg, age in whole years.

```text
SCORE2:     cage = (age - 60)/5, csbp = (sbp - 120)/20, ctc = tc - 6, chdl = (hdl - 1.3)/0.5
SCORE2-OP:  cage = age - 73,     csbp = sbp - 150,      ctc = tc - 6, chdl = hdl - 1.4
x          = the sex's coefficients x (cage, smoking, csbp, ctc, chdl, and each of them x cage)
risk       = 1 - S0^exp(x)                (SCORE2-OP: 1 - S0^exp(x - mean x))
region     = 1 - exp(-exp(scale1 + scale2 x ln(-ln(1 - risk))))
```

The coefficients are in `server/crates/ownhealth-rules/src/calc/score2.rs`. The diabetes term is
always 0 here, because a person with diabetes recorded is refused first.

**Region.** The profile's country picks the ESC risk region, and the region picks scale1 and scale2.
`data/calculators/score2_regions.yaml` lists the four regions, their countries and their numbers.
Spain, France and the United Kingdom are in the low-risk region, for example, and Poland is in the
high-risk region. With no country recorded the result is refused (`country_not_recorded`). With a
country in no region, such as US, it is refused too (`region_not_covered`). We never guess a region.

**Inputs we read.**

- Total and HDL cholesterol from one draw, the newest. A value in mg/dL is divided by 38.67.
- Systolic pressure: the newest office reading (LOINC 8480-6) in the 12 months up to the day. If
  there is none, the mean of the last 30 days of wearable daily means, shown with its window. The
  result then carries the limitation `sbp_from_wearable`.
- Smoking status: the newest answer to LOINC 72166-2 (SNOMED CT). Only "smokes now" counts as a
  smoker. The app records it by hand on the lipid page. A newest answer with no known code is
  refused (`smoking_status_not_coded`) with its words and source; an older answer never stands in.
- The recorded conditions, matched by `data/calculators/conditions.yaml`.

Each input line names its source. A condition that is not on record reads as "no diabetes recorded",
never as "no diabetes".

**Validity.** Each rule is a refusal with its reason. None of them carries a value.

- Age 40 to 69 for SCORE2, 70 to 89 for SCORE2-OP (`age_out_of_range`).
- Sex at birth and birth date recorded (`sex_not_recorded`, `birth_date_not_recorded`).
- SCORE2 is for apparently healthy people. It is refused when any of these is recorded:
  established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or familial
  hypercholesterolaemia (`outside_score2_scope`), or a computed eGFR below 60 (`egfr_below_60`).
- A markedly raised single risk factor puts a person outside SCORE2: total cholesterol above
  8 mmol/L (310 mg/dL), LDL-C above 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or systolic pressure of 180 mmHg or
  more (`marked_risk_factor`).
- A missing cholesterol, systolic pressure or smoking status gives `not_assessed` and names it
  (`missing_input`).
- A caller without read:records or read:vitals gets `not_assessed` (`scope_missing`) with no input
  line: the result reads conditions, medicines and vital signs. Without read:wearables the wearable
  mean is not read.

**Precision.** 1 decimal.

**Worked example.** A man aged 50 in the low-risk region who smokes, with systolic pressure
140 mmHg, total cholesterol 6.3 mmol/L and HDL 1.4 mmol/L: 6.3%. This is the paper's own example.

**Code.** `server/crates/ownhealth-rules/src/calc/score2.rs` and `cardio.rs`. Vectors:
`tests/fixtures/calc/score2.json` and `score2_op.json`, from the papers' supplementary examples as
the R package RiskScorescvd 0.3.1 checks them.

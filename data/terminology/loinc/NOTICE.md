# LOINC notice

`loinc_subset.tsv` contains content from LOINC® (https://loinc.org), version 2.83: 205 codes with
their long common name, component, property, timing, system, scale, example UCUM units and status.
The rows were looked up on the HL7 FHIR terminology server (tx.fhir.org) by
`build_subset.py` from the curated list in `codes.tsv` (both in this folder). The
`alias_group` and `method` columns are ours, not LOINC content.

We ship the LOINC content unmodified; no field was translated or changed. The multilingual names in
`../aliases/` are our own reviewed aliases, not LOINC linguistic variants.
